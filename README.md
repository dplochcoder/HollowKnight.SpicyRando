# HollowKnight.SpicyRando

A collection of questionable combat-focused modifications to Hallownest. Enable in mod options to add spicy features to vanilla (non-rando) saves.

## Rando Integration

Spicy Rando features can, shockingly, be enabled in rando. Though these currently do not affect logic, they are integrated with the rando hash to ensure all rando participants experience comparable suffering.

Spicy Rando is integrated with Rando Settings Manager for easy sharing of settings as well.
